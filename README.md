Building on the success of #GG20 we have implemented our fully functional Learn 2 Earn program. 100% of that funding was used for token acquisition, namely $EARTH, $USDGLO, $CCC, and $GROW.

**Thesis/Abstract**

By tokenizing the learner's journey around tokens that have verifiable social, societal, or environmental impacts; it creates a positive impact on their evaluation of self-worth. 

Specifically, the combination of Acetylcholine (ACh) and Dopamine (DA) production can lead to positive neurotransmitter responses in various areas of the brain. To provide some context Acetylcholine (ACh) is synthesized in the brain when humans participate in altruistic events. Whereas Dopamine (DA) is synthesized when a human has a sense of accomplishment, er go learning.

This effect through the combined accumulation, in time could prove to be very beneficial to the individuals, with regard to the obvious impact it would have on societies, social engagement, and environmental ecosystems.

**Plan of action**

Prior to considering further fundraising efforts, we have expanded our blockchain footprint, to be more inclusive of where communities we want to connect with are building.

We have presence on the following:

* Ethereum Mainnet
* Polygon
* Arbitrum One
* Optimism
* Base
* ZkSync
* Lukso
* Celo

This value add will provide pathways of entry into our KFMEDIA℠ Learning Center powered by CharmVerse and verified through Ethereum Attestations (EAS). Subsequently based on user course completion, token distribution, and EAS written on chain, this has mechanized the necessary tooling to provide meaningful impact reporting.

**Forward Looking Focus**

100% of contributions will further enhance our treasury surrounding this program as we continue to identify more impact tokens using https://www.regenatlas.xyz/  This will be instrumental as we map out our Q4 LATAM expansion to expose to that audience, tokens designed for these purposes. 

***Creating equitable pathways across all economies regardless of sophistication, development, or support by banking or state systems is imperative.***

As we continue to curate more educational content focused on emerging technology and life skills, so too will our expansion of token allocation grow.

We currently offer courses in the following areas of emphasis:
* Blockchain basics masterclass
* Live art demonstrations
* Live cooking classes
* Emotional Intelligence
* DeFi basics

Coming soon:
* Business Builder
* The Future of Business is Web3
* DeFi Demystified
* Financial Literacy

We also have tutorials available covering quadratic funding, liquidity pools, adding RPCs to Metamask, Layerswap, Clave Wallet, and more......

We are positioning ourselves by Q1 2025 to be a fully open community with composable tooling, and scalability to leverage the incoming impact of adopters to the blockchain ecosystem for their initial experience with a positive impact.
